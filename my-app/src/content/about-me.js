      `Hi, I'm Rosie and I'm a recovering academic. I spent 8 years in the trenches of
      laboratory research, battling with cells that had minds of their own. After countless
      of failed experiments, I discovered my true love wasn't the pipetting or the
      endless hours in tissue culture - it was sweet, sweet data and the pure joy of turning it
      into gorgeous visualizations with ggplot2.`,
  
      `Now you'll find me here sharing my coding adventures, probably with the same enthusiasm I once had
      for cells that actually grew in culture - except this time, the code actually does what it's supposed
      to... most of the time, anyway! When it doesn't? Well, that's just part of the fun of debugging, right? ðŸ˜‰`
