      intro: "During lockdown, like many researchers, I found myself with a lot of time on my hands. With no cells to look after in the lab (they were probably missing me too! ðŸ”¬), I had to find something else to keep me busy.",
      conclusion: "What started as a lockdown project quickly became a powerful tool that I hope will help other researchers save time, explore data more efficiently, and maybe even spark new discoveries."
