          <p>
            During lockdown, like many researchers, I found myself with a lot of time on my hands. 
            With no cells to look after in the lab (they were probably missing me too! ðŸ”¬), I had 
            to find something else to keep me busy. And what better way to do that than by drowning 
            myself in vast amounts of gene expression data?
          </p>

          <p>
            During my research, I was constantly downloading and analyzing datasets to track how 
            the 'gene of the week' was expressed at different brain regions and time points. But 
            with so many datasetsâ€”mouse or human, 2D cell cultures or 3D organoids, bulk RNA 
            sequencing or single-cell dataâ€”it quickly became overwhelming. And that's before even 
            touching on epigenetics! Each dataset offered a unique view of brain development, 
            making it a fascinating but complex puzzle to piece together.
          </p>

          <p>
            The more I explored, the more I realized how overwhelming it was to navigate these 
            datasets. Wouldn't it be great, I thought, if there was a way to have all this data 
            in one place? A tool where you could easily select the gene or model you're interested 
            in and visualize how it changes across different brain regions and developmental stages.
          </p>

          <p className="text-center font-semibold text-xl my-8">
            And so, <span className="var(--dark-purple)">NeuroShiny</span> was born! âœ¨
          </p>

          <p>
            With this platform, I wanted to make exploring brain gene expression as intuitive and 
            accessible as possible. Whether you're interested in a specific gene's expression across 
            different time points or comparing human versus mouse data, NeuroShiny brings everything 
            together in one user-friendly interface.
          </p>

          <p>
            What started as a lockdown project quickly became a powerful tool that I hope will help 
            other researchers save time, explore data more efficiently, and maybe even spark new 
            discoveries. Because if there's one thing lockdown taught me, it's that a little boredom 
            and a lot of data can lead to some pretty cool ideas! ðŸš€
